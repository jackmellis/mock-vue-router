# Change Log

## 0.1.3
- Navigating to a nested child route by *name* when the route's path is `''` caused the router to instead navigate to the route's parent. [2](https://github.com/jackmellis/mock-vue-router/issues/2)

## 0.1.2
- `$route` did not inherit the `name` or `meta` data of the matching route. [1](https://github.com/jackmellis/mock-vue-router/issues/1)
